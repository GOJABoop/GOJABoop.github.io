# GOJABoop.github.io
Simple landing page to prove GitHub Pages and Bootstrap CSS theme.


The page shows information about my favorite writer Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentine writer of short stories, poetry, essays as well as literary criticism. 
Borges wrote several highly relevant Spanish-speaking stories that achieved universal transcendence such as "El Aleph", "El Sur" or "El jardin de senderos que se bifurcan".

> "Ah, bear in mind that garden was enchanted"
-Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote, Ficciones


I invite you to read Borges =)
